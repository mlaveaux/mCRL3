/// This proc macro can be used to generate implementations for the types stored
/// in an ATerm, for example DataExpression, DataApplication, DataVariable. This
/// is achieved by adding the proc macro to a module that contains both the
/// declaration and implementation of such a type.
///
/// For every struct containing an ATerm we generate another version for the
/// ATermRef implementation, as well as `protect` and `copy` functions to
/// convert between both types. Furthermore, all of these can be converted to
/// and from ATerms.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// #[mcrl3_derive_terms]
/// mod inner {
///
/// }
///
/// use inner::*;
/// 
/// # Testing
/// 
/// There are a few procedural macros used to replace the code generation performed in the mCRL2 toolset. 
/// Working on procedural macros is typically difficult, but there are unit and integration tests to showcase 
/// common patterns. Alternatively, install `cargo install cargo-expand` and run the command `cargo expand` 
/// in for example `mcrl3-macros` to print the Rust code with the macros expanded.
