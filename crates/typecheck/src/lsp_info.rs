//! Public typing and name-resolution information for a checked specification,
//! keyed by [`Span`] rather than [`crate::ExprId`]: `ExprId` is assigned over
//! the *lowered* expression tree and can contain nodes with no counterpart in
//! the original `DataExpr` a caller parsed, so it cannot be reconstructed
//! externally.
//!
//! This module this deliberately kept apart from the rest of the crate:
//! everything else here is the type checker proper (sort resolution, signature
//! building, inference, lowering), while [`TypingInfo`] is a read-only
//! projection of what that pipeline already decided, re-keyed by source
//! position instead of by whichever internal id each phase happens to use. A
//! caller outside this crate only ever needs
//! [`TypingInfo`]/[`TypedNode`]/[`ResolvedName`], never the machinery that
//! builds them.
//!
//! # Caveats
//!
//! - A node synthesized during lowering has no span of its own and inherits the
//!   span of the whole surface expression it was lowered from — so more than
//!   one [`TypedNode`] can share a span; see [`TypingInfo::at_offset`]'s
//!   tie-break rule.
//! - [`TypedNode::sort`] is *reconstructed* from the resolved sort the type
//!   checker interned, not read from a declaration. It always carries
//!   [`Span::default`]: a resolved sort has no reliable source location of its
//!   own — name resolution and alias normalization both discard or relocate a
//!   [`SortExpression`]'s original span. Do not read source positions out of
//!   it. A sort *reference* (as opposed to the inferred sort of a
//!   data-expression node) is a different thing entirely — see
//!   [`ResolvedName::Sort`] — and its own span is exactly the occurrence's own
//!   source position, since it's captured before normalization ever touches it.
//! - `TypedNode::sort` is `None` for a node with no data sort at all — an
//!   [`ResolvedName::Action`]/[`ResolvedName::Process`] occurrence
//!   (`ProcessExprKind::Action`/ `Id`'s own name span): mCRL2 gives an
//!   action/process reference no data-expression sort to report (its declared
//!   argument sorts are a *domain*, not a value sort) — or a
//!   [`ResolvedName::Sort`] occurrence, which isn't a data expression at all —
//!   unlike every other `TypedNode`, which is always built from a checked
//!   [`merc_syntax::DataExpr`] and so always has one.

//   calls this at exactly the right point in its own pipeline and stashes the raw `(span, name)`
//   pairs on `self` for [`crate::DataSpecification::typing_info`] to resolve once the
//   specification (and its declaration spans, which normalization never touches) is final.
// - Inside a process/PBES/PRES specification's own declarations (`act`/`proc` signatures, `glob`
