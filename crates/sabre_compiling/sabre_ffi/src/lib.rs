//! FFI boundary between the host (which owns the global term pool) and the
//! dynamically compiled-and-loaded rewriter library.
//!
//! # Why a vtable
//!
//! The generated rewriter is compiled as a separate `cdylib` and loaded with
//! `dlopen`. It therefore has its own statically-linked copy of `merc_aterm`
//! and, crucially, its own copy of every global (the term pool, the `dashmap`
//! shard tables, ...). Sharing a `#[repr(Rust)]` structure such as the term
//! pool across that boundary by raw pointer is unsound: Rust gives no layout
//! guarantee for `repr(Rust)` types across independent compilations, so the two
//! sides can disagree on where a field lives. That is exactly what produced the
//! `dashmap` "invalid shard index" panic.
//!
//! Instead, *all* term-pool access happens on the host side. The host fills in
//! a [`SabreRewriteVTable`] of `extern "C-unwind"` function pointers and passes
//! it to the loaded library through [`set_rewrite_vtable`]. The generated code
//! only ever shuffles around opaque, `#[repr(C)]`, pointer-sized handles and
//! dispatches every real operation back into the host through the vtable. Since
//! only a `#[repr(C)]` vtable and `#[repr(C)]` handles cross the boundary, this
//! works regardless of the `rustc` version used to build either side.
