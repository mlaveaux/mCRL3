//! Peak-versus-final diagram size across [`ExplorationStrategy`] variants.
//!
//! Node-wise saturation's whole point is that the *peak* number of live manager nodes over a
//! reachability run stays close to the *final* reachable-set diagram, unlike the whole-set fixpoint
//! schedules (`BreadthFirst`, `Chaining`, `Fixpoint`, `FixpointChaining`), which keep large
//! intermediate frontier diagrams alive simultaneously with the growing state set. See
//! `docs/saturation-implementation-plan.md`, Phase 3.
//!
//! Peak node counts are *not* tracked or asserted on here: getting a precise peak would mean
//! instrumenting `LDDFunction::saturate` itself, inside the `oxidd` fork, which isn't something worth
//! forking `oxidd` for. Instead, build with the `metrics` feature enabled to have
//! `reachability_with_options` log `manager.num_inner_nodes()` — an approximation of table size, since
//! it counts every live node in the manager, relations and metas included — plus oxidd's own
//! per-`LDDOp` call/cache-query/cache-hit counters, once per outer iteration/round, so the peak is a
//! manual, eyeballed reading rather than an asserted number:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --release -p merc_symbolic --features metrics --test saturation_benchmark -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! The node-count line is logged via `log::info!`, like the rest of this crate's progress reporting,
//! so — unlike oxidd's own op counters below, which go straight to stderr — it needs a logger
//! configured to be visible; `cargo test` binaries don't configure one, so under the invocation above
//! only the op-counter lines actually appear. Run the same fixture through `merc-lps`/`merc-sym`
//! (which do configure a logger) with `--features metrics` and `RUST_LOG=info` to see both.
//!
//! This deliberately deviates from the plan's Phase 3 "done when", which called for an always-run
//! regression test asserting `Saturation`'s peak strictly below `BreadthFirst`'s: without a fork
//! change there is nothing precise enough to assert on, and adding one for a benchmark's sake was
//! judged not worth carrying upstream. The evidence for the claim is this printed table instead.
//!
//! `final_nodes` in the printed table comes from [`oxidd::Function::node_count`] (pre-existing
//! upstream API, unrelated to the peak logging above): the size of the diagram rooted at the final
//! reachable set, as opposed to [`LDDFunction::len`]'s vector count.
