//!
//! Given the current triple (region_function, strategy, prio), referred to as
//! state, a region R is extracted by means of the query function. An alpha-region
//! is a set of vertices R and a witness strategy sigma. So that for all plays
//! consistent with sigma, they either stay within R and are winning for alpha.
//! Or they escape R via vertices having the highest priority in the game. The
//! initial state is (priority_function, empty_strategy, min(range(priority_function)))
//!
//! If the region R is a dominion in the whole game, the dominion is removed from
//! the game and the algorithm runs on the remaining game. If the extracted region
//! is open in the subgame G >= prio. Which is the subgame with only vertices
//! having greater or equal priority then prio. The next state becomes
//! (region_function\[R -> prio\], strategy\*, min(range(region_function >= prio))).
//!
//! If the alpha-region is a dominion in the subgame G >= prio, the lowest priority
//! region that the opponent can flee to is determined in [`PriorityPromotionSolver::promote_sub_dominion`].
//! And then the next state becomes (region_function\*\[R -> prio\*\], strategy\*, prio\*), and
//! in region_function\* all regions below prio\* are reset to the original priority.
//!
//! The strategy\* was not presented in the paper, but was partially determined
//! by the follow up paper Improving Priority Promotion for parity games. For
//! the attractor for some region R the strategy is determined by the witness
//! that alpha can reach R. For vertices inside the region R a witness core strategy
//! sigma is given. For all vertices inside R where no strategy is defined yet
//! an arbitrary successor inside R is taken to complete the strategy.
