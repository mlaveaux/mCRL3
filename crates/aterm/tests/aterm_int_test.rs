/// `is_int_term` recognizes a term purely by comparing its head symbol against
/// the pool's reserved `<aterm_int>` marker symbol. Since the symbol pool used
/// to share symbols by name and arity with no reserved-name guard,
/// `Symbol::new("<aterm_int>", 0)` used to hand out that very same reserved
/// symbol, so a constant built from it was indistinguishable from a real
/// integer term even though it carries no annotation value. `ATermInt::value`
/// would then read past the end of the term's allocation.
///
/// `Symbol::new` now panics on any name/arity that collides with one of the
/// pool's reserved marker symbols, so forging one this way is no longer
/// possible at all.
