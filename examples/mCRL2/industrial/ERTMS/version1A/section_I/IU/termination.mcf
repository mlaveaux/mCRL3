% We check that on all reachable states of the system (while traversing non-expire_timer actions)
% the system never enters a state in which one (or more) VSSs change state infinitely oten without
% ever stabilising.
% Technically, this means that for all reachable states we require that any computation involving
% only change(v,s1,s2) actions or (ptd_)continue actions is finite.
