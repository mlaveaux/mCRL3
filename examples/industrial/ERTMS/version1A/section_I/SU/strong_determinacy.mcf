% We check that on all reachable states of the system (while traversing non-expire_timer actions)
% the system never enters a state in which a VSS's next state is not-determined.
% Technically, this means that on all reachable states we require that for any pair of 
% action change(v,s,s1) and change(v,s,s2), when enabled, we have s1 = s2.
